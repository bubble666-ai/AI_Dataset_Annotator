\# üß† AI-Powered Dataset Annotator with Active Learning



This project is an advanced web application designed to accelerate the annotation process for image datasets. By combining Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and Active Learning techniques, this tool automatically generates initial "weak labels" and then intelligently prioritizes the most uncertain samples for human review. It offers a practical solution to one of the biggest bottlenecks in the AI industry: the time and cost of data labeling.

\### ‚ú® Key Features



\*   \*\*ü§ñ Auto Weak-Labeling:\*\* Leverages the powerful \*\*Google Gemini 1.5 Flash\*\* model to generate initial labels for an entire unlabeled dataset.

\*   \*\*üß† Active Learning Strategy:\*\* Implements an \*\*Uncertainty Sampling\*\* strategy to prioritize the review queue. The tool always presents the image with the lowest model confidence score first, maximizing the impact of human-in-the-loop feedback.

\*   \*\*‚ö° Efficient User Interface:\*\* A clean and fast UI built with \*\*Streamlit\*\*, allowing users to quickly verify or correct AI-generated labels.

\*   \*\*üìä Progress Management:\*\* Automatically saves verified labels and tracks overall progress, allowing the annotation process to be paused and resumed.
